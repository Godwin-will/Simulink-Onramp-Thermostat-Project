# Simulink-Onramp-Thermostat-Project
In this project, I learnt how to use MATLAB Simulink in modeling controllers such as the thermostat for real time thermal management in a house. 
Some of the tools used include the gain block, unit delay block, and addition block for performing various mathematical operations in the modeling of 
the controller.
